## Pusher Server SDK Pattern

Most server SDKs can target Sockudo by setting host/port.

```ts [node.js]
import Pusher from "pusher";

const pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: "app-id",
  key: "app-key",
  secret: "app-secret",
  cluster: "mt1",
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 6001,
  useTLS: false,
});

await pusher.trigger("orders", "order.updated", { id: 42 });
```

## Auth Endpoint Helpers

Node SDK helpers:

- `authorizeChannel(socketId, channelName[, presenceData])`

These signatures are accepted by Sockudo for private/presence auth.

## Webhooks

If you process webhooks, verify signatures with `X-Pusher-Signature` against the raw body and app secret, same as Pusher-style flow.

## SDK-Agnostic Fallback

If you do not use a server SDK, call Sockudo HTTP API directly with signed query params:

- `/apps/{appId}/events`
- `/apps/{appId}/batch_events`

See [Server HTTP API](/server/http-api).
