## Basic Config

```ts
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

const pusher = new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1",
  wsHost: "your.sockudo.host",
  wsPort: 6001,
  wssPort: 443,
  forceTLS: true,
  enabledTransports: ["ws", "wss"],
});
```

## Auth

Use normal Pusher auth endpoint setup:

```ts
const pusher = new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1",
  wsHost: "your.sockudo.host",
  wsPort: 6001,
  forceTLS: false,
  authEndpoint: "https://api.example.com/pusher/auth",
  authTransport: "ajax",
});
```

## What Works

- Public/private/presence channels.
- Client events.
- Channel member lists and count queries through Sockudo HTTP API.

## What Is Missing

pusher-js does not provide first-class API for Sockudo extensions:

- subscription `filter` payload helpers.
- automatic handling of `pusher:delta` messages.
- channel-level delta options in subscribe API.

For those, switch to `@sockudo/client`.
