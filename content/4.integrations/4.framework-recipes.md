## React

Create a singleton client and subscribe in effects:

```ts
import Pusher from "@sockudo/client";

export const pusher = new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1",
  wsHost: "127.0.0.1",
  wsPort: 6001,
  forceTLS: false,
});
```

## Vue / Nuxt

Initialize in plugin scope and inject in app:

```ts
import Pusher from "@sockudo/client";

const pusher = new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1",
  wsHost: "127.0.0.1",
  wsPort: 6001,
  forceTLS: false,
});
```

## Web Worker

Use worker entrypoint:

```ts
import WorkerPusher from "@sockudo/client/worker";
```

## When to Stay with Echo/Pusher-js

If you only need core channel/event behavior and existing Echo ecosystem wrappers, keep them.  
Move to `@sockudo/client` when you need filters or delta compression.
