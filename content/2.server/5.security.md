## API Request Authentication

`/apps/*` HTTP endpoints enforce signed query authentication with HMAC-SHA256 signatures.

Use:

- strict clock sync
- HTTPS in production
- server-side secret storage only

## Channel Authorization

- Public channels: no auth.
- `private-*` / `presence-*`: `auth` signature required.
- Presence requires `channel_data` with `user_id`.

## User Signin Security

If `enable_user_authentication` is on, `pusher:signin` must use signed `auth` with signed `user_data`.

## Origin Validation

Per-app `allowed_origins` can restrict WebSocket origins.

Supported patterns include:

- exact domains (`app.example.com`)
- protocol-specific (`https://app.example.com`)
- wildcards (`*.example.com`)
- explicit ports (`localhost:3000`)

If origin validation is configured and origin is missing or disallowed, connection is rejected.

## CORS

HTTP CORS is configurable separately from WebSocket origin checks:

```json
{
  "cors": {
    "origin": ["https://app.example.com"],
    "methods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
    "allowed_headers": ["Authorization", "Content-Type"],
    "credentials": true
  }
}
```

## TLS and Reverse Proxy

Options:

- Native TLS (`ssl.enabled=true`)
- TLS termination at ingress/load-balancer

For Unix deployments, Sockudo can bind to a Unix domain socket and stay behind Nginx/Traefik.

## Rate Limiting

Enable and tune API/WebSocket protections:

```bash
RATE_LIMITER_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMITER_API_MAX_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMITER_API_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
RATE_LIMITER_WS_MAX_REQUESTS=20
RATE_LIMITER_WS_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
```
