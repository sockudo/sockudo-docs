Sockudo is a **Pusher protocol-compatible WebSocket server** written in Rust.  
You can keep existing Pusher-style integrations while running realtime infrastructure yourself.

## What You Install

- `sockudo`: the server runtime (WebSocket + HTTP API + metrics).
- `@sockudo/client`: official JavaScript client with enhanced Sockudo features.

## Compatibility Model

Sockudo is designed to be a drop-in replacement for core Pusher flows:

- WebSocket connection and channel subscriptions.
- Public / private / presence channels.
- Client events on private/presence channels.
- Pusher-style HTTP API event publishing with signed requests.

::tip
Advanced features like **tag-filter subscription API** and **automatic delta decode** require `@sockudo/client` (or a custom client implementing Sockudo extensions).
