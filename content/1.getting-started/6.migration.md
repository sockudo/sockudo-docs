## Migration Strategy

Use phased rollout:

1. Keep your existing clients (pusher-js / Echo), point them to Sockudo host.
2. Move backend event publishing to Sockudo HTTP API or Pusher server SDK targeting Sockudo.
3. Validate auth endpoints and presence behavior.
4. Adopt `@sockudo/client` only for advanced features (filters/delta).

## Client Config Diff (Basic)

```ts [before-after.ts]
// before (hosted Pusher)
new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "eu",
  forceTLS: true,
});

// after (Sockudo)
new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1",
  wsHost: "your.sockudo.host",
  wsPort: 6001,
  wssPort: 443,
  forceTLS: true,
  enabledTransports: ["ws", "wss"],
});
```

## Backend Trigger Diff

Most Pusher server SDKs can target Sockudo by setting `host` and `port`.

```ts
new Pusher({
  appId: process.env.PUSHER_APP_ID,
  key: process.env.PUSHER_APP_KEY,
  secret: process.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET,
  host: "your.sockudo.host",
  port: 6001,
  useTLS: false,
});
```

## Compatibility Notes

- Core protocol behavior is Pusher-compatible.
- Signed HTTP API query parameters are required for `/apps/*` routes.
- Advanced tag filtering and delta decode are not native in stock pusher-js/Echo clients.

::note
For Sockudo-only features, migrate frontend clients to `@sockudo/client` incrementally, channel by channel if needed.

## Recommended Rollout Checks

- `/up` and `/up/{appId}` healthy.
- Private and presence auth succeeds.
- Message fanout latency and ordering match expectations.
- Webhooks and metrics endpoints wired in production.
