## 1) Connect a Client

`sockudo` accepts standard Pusher WebSocket clients.

```ts [app.ts]
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

const pusher = new Pusher("app-key", {
  cluster: "mt1", // required by many clients, not used by Sockudo host routing
  wsHost: "127.0.0.1",
  wsPort: 6001,
  forceTLS: false,
  enabledTransports: ["ws"],
});

const channel = pusher.subscribe("my-channel");
channel.bind("my-event", (payload: unknown) => {
  console.log("received:", payload);
});
```

## 2) Trigger an Event (Backend SDK)

Use a backend Pusher-compatible server SDK for signed publish requests.

```ts [trigger.ts]
import Pusher from "pusher";

const pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: "app-id",
  key: "app-key",
  secret: "app-secret",
  cluster: "mt1",
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 6001,
  useTLS: false,
});

await pusher.trigger("my-channel", "my-event", {
  message: "hello from Sockudo",
  sentAt: Date.now(),
});
```

## 3) Verify Realtime Flow

When the backend trigger runs, your subscribed client should receive `my-event` immediately.

## Using `@sockudo/client` Instead

For core behavior, either client works:

```ts [client.ts]
import Pusher from "@sockudo/client";
```

Use `@sockudo/client` if you need advanced Sockudo extensions like tag filters or delta decode.
