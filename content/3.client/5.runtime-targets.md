## Browser

```ts
import Pusher from "@sockudo/client";
```

Default export resolves to web build in browser environments.

## Node.js

```ts
import Pusher from "@sockudo/client";
```

Node target uses native modern APIs (`WebSocket`, `fetch`-first auth/timeline flow).

## Web Worker

```ts
import WorkerPusher from "@sockudo/client/worker";
```

Use worker entrypoint to avoid incorrect runtime shims.

## React Native

```ts
import ReactNativePusher from "@sockudo/client/react-native";
```

Optional peer dependency:

```bash
npm install @react-native-community/netinfo
```

## Encryption Builds

- `@sockudo/client/with-encryption`
- `@sockudo/client/worker/with-encryption`

Use these for `private-encrypted-*` channel workflows.
