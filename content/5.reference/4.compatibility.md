| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public/private/presence channels | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Channel auth endpoint flow | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| User signin flow | Yes (manual wiring) | Partial | Yes |
| Client events (`client-*`) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tag filter subscribe API | No | No | Yes |
| Automatic delta decode | No | No | Yes |
| Per-subscription delta options | No | No | Yes |

## Server SDK Compatibility

| Capability | Pusher server SDK pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Event trigger | Works by setting Sockudo `host`/`port` |

## Migration Guidance

- Stay on Echo/pusher-js if you need only core Pusher behavior.
- Add `@sockudo/client` when adopting tag filtering or delta compression on clients.
